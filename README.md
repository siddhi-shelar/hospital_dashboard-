Hospital Work and Leads Workflow Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing hospital operations, patient records, and doctor feedback. The dashboard helps hospital administrators and management teams track bed occupancy, patient billing, diagnosis distribution, and follow-ups for better decision-making and operational efficiency.

ðŸ“‚ Dashboard Features
ðŸ”¹ Key KPIs

Admit Date: Patient admission timeline.

Discharge Date: Track patient discharge trends.

Follow Up: Follow-up schedule for patients.

Billing Amount: Total billing and insurance claims.

ðŸ”¹ Visual Insights
